The goal is to formulate a wob-vortext of the highest order possible

Have you ever come across poorly designed, wonky code? Perhaps you've found HTML markup embedded in a Ruby class, javascript being written dynamically by some other language (python, PHP, etc.), or CSS being dynamically rendered in order to avoid some other, more elegantly designed approach to a problem? This is called a **wob vortex**.  There is no bound to the amount of joy, sorrow, laughs and tears such vortices can provide for the hapless developer who wanders in unawares. 

The _order_ of a wob vortex is defined as the number of levels of distinct nested languages that it encapsulates.  The goal of this repo is to create a Hello World or similar sample application exemplifying a wob vortex of the highest possible order.
