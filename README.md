wobvortex
=========

The goal is to formulate a wob-vortext of the highest order possible

Have you ever come across poorly designed, wonky code? Perhaps you've found HTML markup embedded in a Ruby class, javascript being written dynamically by some other language (python, PHP, etc.), or CSS being dynamically rendered in order to avoid some other, more elegantly designed approach to a problem? This is called a **wob vortex**.  Despite the fact that many of us :sweat_smile: have perhaps created our own contribution to the wob vortex ecosystem during our formative years of learning web and application development, for the somewhat seasoned developer wandering past such a system (or ensnared by it by for social, financial, or other reasons), there is no bound to the amount of joy, pain, giggles and tears such vortices can provide. 

> The _order_ of a wob vortex is defined as the **number of levels of distinct nested languages it encapsulates**.  The goal of this repo is to create a Hello World or similar sample application exemplifying a wob vortex of the highest possible order.
